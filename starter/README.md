# MyReads Project

This is a book app that tracks what you are currently reading, have read and want to read. It has a search functionality for searching new books and adding them to your bookshelves. Whenever you want to add or move the book to a certain bookshelf you need to press the green button on the left bottom side of the specific book and then just press whichever option you want. Everything will then update and the book will be displayed in the correct shelf.

To start this app first you need to install all the dependencies. First check if you are in the correct filepath, you need to be located in `my-reads/starter` To do that just run `npm install`, after everything is done you can start the app with command `npm run start` or `npm start`.
